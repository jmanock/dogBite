        <h3>I am so thankful I found you!</h3>
        <small>May 4, 2017</small>
        <p>I want to thank you for your kindness, patience, and knowledge. You were readily available when I called you. I called you flustered, nervous and panicking; our 7 year old family dog had been labeled a "dangerous dog" and I needed insurance! You calmed me down, made me realize how easy it was to get the insurance and have it in my hands right away. You actually walked me through the form! I am so thankful I found you! </p>

        <p>I got everything done. You are so helpful. I do not know how I could have had a better experience getting that insurance. Only thing better is if I was not required to do so...

        <p>I just wanted to thank you for being so helpful last week when Jim called you to report the dog bite. He was really upset when he called me to tell me what happened, but after he talked to you he felt so much better. I'm sure you know how stressful it can be, and I just wanted to say thanks for being the voice of reason.</p>

        <h3>Our two dangerous breeds (pitbull and boxer) were excluded from out homeowner's insurance.</h3>
        <small class='date'>May 1, 2015</small>
        <p>We had to purchase dog insurance when our two dangerous breeds (pitbull and boxer) were excluded from our homeowner's insurance. FIDO has the cheapest rates for the past few years, and excellent customer service. Debbie quickly responds to emails and answers all questions you could have about your policy. They are awesome!!</p>
