  <h2>What is a Canine Liability Policy?</h2>
  <p>It is a standalone policy that covers injuries or damages which are caused by your dog. Most people think only of dog bites; however, bites are just one reason people are suing dog owners. If your dog scratches, scares, causes a person to fall or if your dog injures another animal, it is likely you will hear from a lawyer. Coverage is provided on and off your premises anywhere in the united States. Many landlords and municipalities are requesting to be added as "Additional Insureds" providing them with liability coverage for injuries or damages caused by your dog and so they can be notified of any changes or cancellations.</p>

All payments must be received and authorized by either a debit or credit card processing company. The changes will appear on your statement from "Dual Commercial" they are assisting us.

  <p>We are willing to review all dogs. You will be asked to give us information on the incident or incidents leading to the label. If your quote comes back as a "referral", that means the underwriters want to review your application closer. You will receive the final decision in a separate email.</p>

  <p>If your dog goes to work with you but does not assist you, other than greeting customers or visiting with staff or employees, we can include coverage.</p>
  <h2>I need coverage because my dog is intergral or involved in my work.</h2>
  <p>If you use your dog in your line of work and consider it to be "Involved" or "Integral" we can provide coverage. For example, many dogs are used in certain lines of work to sniff out bombs, drugs, bed bugs, physical therapy or counseling.</p>
  <h2>What is an "additional insured"?</h2>
  <p>You may be asked to name your landlord, employer, a governmental entity or other interested parties on the policy in the event your dog injures someone or causes damage. You may add one or more, but you must have their name, address, and contact information (either phone or e-mail). There is a $50 charge per separate address to add them to your policy. You do not need to add a spouse, significant other or family memeber as an "Additional Insured", if they reside at the same address as you, as they are already covered under the policy.</p>
  <h2>What does the "additional insured" endorsement do?</h2>
  <p>If your dog injures a person or another animal an  your landlord or other "Additional Insured" is sued, this policy will protect you and your landlord (and any other "Additional Insured") for medical costs for the injured party, defense costs and settlement costs, if any.</p>
  <h2>Explain Diligent Effort Form or Surplus Lines Disclosure Statement</h2>
  <p>This coverage is available through the Excess and Surplus marketplace. These types of policies are often called non-admitted or non-licensed. The primary difference between this policy and an admitted policy is that if the insurance company were to go out of business, there would be no protection under your State Guaranty Fund. However, this policy is through one of the largest syndicates at Lloyd's of London is one of the oldest insurance providers in the world. To prove that you have been made aware that the policy is non-admitted, you may have to sign a form predetermined by your state.</p>
  <h2>What if I need to make changes during the year?</h2>
  <p>There is a tab for "Changes". Simply complete the information and it will be sent for processing. If there are additional charges, we will be in touch. Changes are not automated yet, so it will take some time to get proof of changes to you. Normally, this should take about 1-2 weeks to process. If it is urgent, please let us know. We can update your address, email or phone number. The policy, however, cannot be assigned or transferred to a new owner. The new owner would need to purchase their own policy your policy would be canceled and any return premium returned.</p>
  <h2>What happes if I cancel before the end of the year?</h2>
  <p>The policy can be canceled at any time. If there are any "Additional Insureds", we have an obligation to notify them of the cancellation. After the first ninety days, the return premium is determined by your individual states' laws and regulations; however, no fees are ever returned. Should you purchase the policy and decide to cancel for any reason (even minutes later), 25% of the premium in nonrefundable.</p>

If you have chosen a payment plan, there may be additional payments collected before processing is complete; however, we will return every penny we owe you.</p>
  <h2>What happens if I do not pay my installments?</h2>
  <p>All installments will be drawn directly from the debit or credit card uses to purchase the policy without additional action by you. If you are cnceled for nonpayment of premium or insufficient funds in your account we will return any premium that has been paid but not earned (meaning used up). Fees will not be refunded and we cannot reinstate your coverage. Again, we are obligated to notify any and all "additional Insureds" of cancellation.</p>
  <h2>Renewing your policy!</h2>
  <p>Starting at about 6 weeks prior to policy expiration, you will receive a series of emails. If you want to renew, all current information will be included for you to review, including information on your dog and your contact information.

If your policy was canceled during the year, we will not contact you further.</p>
  <h2>Why are our premiums lower than other companies?</h2>
  <p>This policy was designed with a unique rating and underwriting process. The questions you answer give us the information we need to determine if we can offer you a quote and for what price. Automation is necessary to readily assist as many owners as possible at the lowest cost and to do so in the most efficient and timely manner.</p>
