  <h2>Do you cover all breeds?</h2>
  <p>Yes, we cover all breeds, including those normally considered dangerous such as Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, Saint Bernard's, Great Danes, Dobermans and Huskies, whether pure or mixed breeds.</p>
  <h2>How do I do this?</h2>
  <p>This policy is just like any other policy, you get your quote, decide if you want to purchase and conclude the process. This is a FULLY automated program, it is designed to be easy, quick and convenient. It is also the reason the premium is less that most other policies.</p>
  <h2>What is a Canine Liability Policy?</h2>
  <p>It is a standalone policy that covers injuries or damages which are caused by your dog. Most people think only of dog bites; however, bites are just one reason people are suing dog owners. If you dog scratches, scares, causes a person to fall or if your dog injures another animal, it is likely you will hear from a lawyer. Many landlords and municipalities are requesting to be added as "Additional Insureds" providing them with liability coverage for injuries or damages caused by your dog and so they can be notified of any changes or cancellations.</p>
  <h2>How do I get a quote?</h2>
  <p>Hit the "Get a Quote" button on the website. You will be asked to answer primarily drop down questions, then hit "calculate" at the bottom of the page. If you have more than one dog, there is an "Add Dog" button at the top left corner of the quote. You will need to answer the same questions for each dog.

  <h2>Do you have payment plans?</h2>
  <p>Payment options and plans will vary depending on the amount of the premium they will appear on the page with your quote. The <span class='boldFont'>QUOTE</span> you will receive is for an annual policy which is 12 months or one year. All payments must be received and authorized by either a debit or credit card processing company. The charges will appear on your statement from "Dual Commercial" they are assisting us. The only Rip Off reports about the program are the result of cancelation due to nonpayment of premiums, only the insurer can reinstate coverage we do not have the authority to without their approval. <span class='boldFont'>There is no Deductible!</span></p>
  <h2>What limits are available?</h2>
  <p>We have four options for coverage $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, and $300,000. At this time we are unable to assist with higher limits such as $500,000 and up.</p>
  <h2>What if my dog has a behavior history or has been labeled dangerous by a governing body?</h2>
  <p>We are willing to review all dogs. YOu will be asked to give us information on the incident or incidents leading to the label. If your quote comes back as a "referral", that means the underwriters want to review your application closer. You will reveive the final decision in a separate email.</p>
  <h2>I need coverage because my dog works with me or comes to work with me.</h2>
  <p>If you dog goes to work with you but does not assist you, other than greeting customers or visiting with staff or employees, we can include coverage.</p>
  <h2>I need coverage because my dog is integral or involved in my work</h2>
  <p>If you use your dog in your line of work and consider it to be "involved" or "integral" we can provide coverage. For example, many dogs are used in certain lines of work to sniff out bombs, dregs, bed bugs, physical therapy or counseling.</p>
  <h2>What is an "Additional Insured"?</h2>
  <p>You may be asked to name your landlord, employer, a governmental entity or other interested parties on the policy in the event your dog injures someone or causes damage. You may add one or more, but you mush have their name, address, and contact information (either phone or e-mail). There is a $50 charge per separate address to add them to your policy. You do not need to add a spouse, significant other or family member as an "Additional Insured", if they reside at the same address as you, as they are already covered under the policy.</p>
  <h2>What does the "additional Insured" endorsement do?</h2>
  <p>If your dog injures a person or another animal and your landlord or other "additional Insured" is sued, this policy will protect you and your landlord (and any other "Additional Insured") for medical costs for the injured party, defense costs and settlement costs, if any.</p>
  <h2>Explain Diligent Effort Form or Surplus Lines disclosure statement.</h2>
  <p>This coverage is available through the Excess and Surplus marketplace. These types of policies are often called non-admitted or non-licensed. The primary difference between this policy and an admitted policy is that if the insurance company were to go out of business, there would be no protection under your State Guaranty Fund. However, this policy is through one of the largest syndicates at Lloyd's of London is one of the oldest insurance providers in the world. To prove that you have been made aware that the policy is non-admitted, you may have to sign a form predetermined by your state.</p>
  <h2>What if I need to make changes during the year?</h2>
  <p>There is a tab for "Changes". Simply complete the information and it will be sent for processing. If there are additional charges, we will be in touch. Changes are not automated yes, so it will take some time to get proof of changes to you. Normally, this should take about 1 - 2 weeks to process. If it is urgent, please let us know. We can update your address, email or phone number. The policy, however, cannot be assigned or transferred to a new owner. The new owner would need to purchase their own policy your policy would be canceled and any return premium returned.</p>
