  <h2>What is a canine liability policy?</h2>
  <p>It is a standalone policy that covers injuries or damages which are caused by your dog. Most people think only of dog bites; however, bites are just one reason people are suing dog owners. If your dog scratches, scares, causes a person to fall or if your dog injures another animal, it is likely you will hear from a lawyer. Coverage is provided on and off your premises anywhere in the United States. Many landlords and municipalities are requesting to be added as "additional Insureds" providing them with liability coverage for injuries or damages caused by your dog and so they can be notified of any changes or cancellations.</p>

  <p>This coverage is available through the Excess and Surplus marketplace. These types of policies are often called non-admitted or non-licensed.

We can update your address, email or phone number. the policy, however, cannot be assigned or transferred to a new owner. The new owner would need to purchase their own policy your policy would be canceled and any return premium returned.</p>

  <p>All installments will be drawn directly from the debit or credit card uses to purchase the policy without additional action by you.

Fees will not be refunded and we cannot reinstate your coverage. Again, we are obligated to notify any and all "Additional Insureds" of cancellation.</p>
